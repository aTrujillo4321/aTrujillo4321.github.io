            <h2>Step by step </h2>
            <p> Binary is count in a base-2 system, meaning that only 1s and 0s are only applicable. </p>
            <br>
            <p> 0 is 0000, 1 is 0001, and 2 is 0010. Any 'one' placed on the last number in binary --- would be an odd number in base-10 (or 0 through 9). Any 'zero' placed as the last would be even.  </p>
            <p> 3 is 0011, 4 is 0100, and 5 is 0101. Once a 'one' is filled like '11', then it would go to '100'. From there, when it reaches '111', then it would go into '1000'. It repeats over and over, trying to fill in the ones. </p>

            <h2> A small example </h2>
            <P> Let's do 1111. Spoilers, if you convert it to a normal number, then it would be 15. But how did we get there? </P>
            <p> Since the number ends with a one, then it ends with odd. There are four digits in 1111, and in order to get to fifteen, we have to start from  the back. </p>
            <p> Because its in base-2, there is a formula for binary, and that is 2*<sup>n</sup>. n is the number in which digit is on the line, and n is zero in the back. If 1111 has four digits, it would lead to a formula, a formula that would go by 2*<sup>3</sup> + 2*<sup>2</sup> + 2*<sup>1</sup> + 2*<sup>0</sup>.
