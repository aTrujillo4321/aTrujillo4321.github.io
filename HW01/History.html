            <h2> Origins </h2>
            <p> When it came to origins, the first discovery, or rather when it was created, went by the name of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Born in the 17th century, he was the first to propose a digit systems of only ones and zeros. In short, he was the man who built upon the two-digit system, but he wasn't the only one. </p>
            <p> Other societies had systems close to the binary system we have today. For instance, ancient Egyptians had "Horus-Eye" fractions, which was a measurement to count grains and liquids. Not only the Egyptians, but I Ching from China is also another contender. I Ching symbols have hexagrams and trigrams, which were incremented in binary. In fact, it is so close to modern binary, that even Liebniz himself was interested in that particular system. </p>
            <p> And some scholars were close to achieving of what Liebniz did. Pingala, a scholar from India, invented something that almost resembled what binary could've been. He used a system that used short and long syllables, which represtented ones and zeros. However, it started at one rather than zero. Other European scholars, like Thomas Harriot and Francis Bacon, also invented similar systems to modern binary. Harriot believed his ones and zeros could be used for counting, whereas Bacon replaced his ones and zeros for a's and b's. Despite both of them being close, there was one man who crackled the code. Litteraly. </p>

            <h2><b> Leibniz </b></h2>
            <p> Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz was a 17th century mathematician, who was known as the godfather of binary code. Not only that, but he was also a political advisor, which is another term for a man connected in politics. When he was just a young man, he wanted to revolutionize, as he was inspired by many figures like Galileo, and Rene Descartes. More or less, he was first majoring in law, but that didn't mean he would be knowledgeable only in it. </p>
            <p> Starting in 1675, Liebniz laid the foundation of of both integral and differential calculus. He considered time and space as substances, and began to develop that concepts of of motion contained an element of imaginary. Which in turn, provides an explanation the course of phenonema. </p>
