            <h2> The Basics of Binary </h2>
            <p> Binary is the way in which code or data is being presented. For instance, instead of letters and numbers, the data is being translated into sets of only zeros and ones. This is the basis of computer systems. Because of this, it leads to the system to to understand user input, and even present decent output after a run. </p>
            <P> Everyone, from five years olds to seniors, all use the decimal system. In other words, we use base 10, or 0 through 9. There are other famous decimal systems, like hexadecimal, but binary only focuses on two digits. Here is a simple picture of what binary may look like below. </P>
            <p> Binary code is really important. Without it, many programmers and coders wouldn't be able to view websites, create documents, access software, perform analysis, or even play video games! In short, binary numbers are essential to development, and we wouldn't be able to play our favorite call of duty game without them. </p>

            <h2><b> To be or not to be </b></h2>
            <p> Since binary only uses two digits, it makes it a base-2 system. When 1 is on, then 0 is off. Or in general terms, 1 is true and 0 is false. </p>
